        <p class="hidden leftText">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
        takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius, god of commerce,
        messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes. Like Venus, Mercury 
        orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never
        exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the 
        eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more 
        difficult to observe than Venus.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun 
        in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for 
        every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital 
        motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day 
        every two Mercurian years. Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975 and MESSENGER, launched 
        in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on 
        April 30, 2015.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
        As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked
        eye in broad daylight. Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes 
        with a day-night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few hours following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At 
        times, it has been seen in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 
        117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than 
        any other planet in the Solar System.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">The third smallest planet in the Solar System, Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes 
        called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It`s 
        radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting 
        of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure 
        of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m underwater on Earth. Mercury is closer to the Sun, but Venus has the hottest 
        surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 464 °C. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly 
        reflective clouds of sulfuric acid.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While 
        large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of 
        Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface 
        is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, 
        interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field 
        that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and 
        oxygen.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by 
        atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the 
        planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. 
        A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such 
        as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life. Earth is an ellipsoid 
        with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the 
        largest and most massive.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being 
        larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with 
        a thin atmosphere, and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron 
        and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and 
        irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos. Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the 
        largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest 
        canyons in the Solar System.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be 
        a large impact feature. Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation 
        period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due 
        to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Both of Mars's polar ice caps 
        appear to be made largely of water. In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. 
        However, it is unknown whether life has ever existed on Mars. Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, 
        beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant 
        with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less 
        than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the 
        Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the 
        gods. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. 
        It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a 
        well-defined solid surface.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. 
        Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the 
        equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their 
        interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at 
        least 1831. Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is 
        nearly 800 million km long, covering nearly the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly 
        many more</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
        It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average 
        density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn's interior is most likely 
        composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock. Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate 
        layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia 
        crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to 
        Saturn's planetary magnetic field.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is 
        generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h, 
        higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune. The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which 
        is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit 
        Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's 
        largest moon, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a 
        substantial atmosphere.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, 
        Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Mars, grandfather of Jupiter and father of Saturn. 
        It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in 
        composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and 
        Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other 
        giant planets. As with gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined "solid surface." Uranus's atmosphere is similar to 
        Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 
        -224 °C, and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the 
        uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock Like the other giant planets, Uranus 
        has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of 
        rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most 
        other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible 
        light.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar 
        System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 
        times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than 
        Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred to as one of the 
        solar system's two ice giant planets. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined "solid surface". 
        The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 4.5 billion km. It is named after the Roman god of 
        the sea.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by 
        mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 
        September 1846 within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly 
        thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The 
        planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. 
        Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. Voyager 2 remains 
        the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.</p>

        <p class="hidden leftText">Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. In 1930, 
        it was the first object discovered in the Kuiper belt, when it was declared the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 
        1990s, following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt including the dwarf planet Eris, and the 
        scattered disc, Pluto's status as a planet was questioned. In 2006 the IAU formally re-defined the term planet, reclassifying 
        Pluto as a dwarf planet. Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the 
        largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is 
        primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small.</p>

        <p class="hidden rightText">Compared to Earth's Moon, Pluto has only one sixth the mass, and one third the volume. Pluto has 
        a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 AU from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach 
        Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a 
        stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding. Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. 
        Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either 
        body, and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons became the first spacecraft to perform a brief flyby of Pluto on 
        July 14, 2015</p>
